### üßÆ Core Mathematical Formulas

#### Pre-Retirement (Accumulation):
1. `Annual_Income[year] = Annual_Income[year-1] √ó (1 + Income_Growth_Rate)`
2. `Annual_Contribution = Annual_Income √ó (Savings_Rate / 100)`
3. `Investment_Return = Beginning_Balance √ó Pre_Retirement_Return_Rate`
4. `Year_End_Balance = Beginning_Balance + Annual_Contribution + Investment_Return`

#### Post-Retirement (Withdrawal):
1. `Required_Annual_Income = Final_Annual_Income √ó (Income_Replacement_Ratio / 100)`
2. `Annual_Government_Benefits = (CPP + OAS + Company_Pension + Other_Income) √ó 12`
3. `Annual_Withdrawal_Needed = Required_Annual_Income - Annual_Government_Benefits`
4. `Investment_Return = (Beginning_Balance - Annual_Withdrawal) √ó Retirement_Return_Rate`
5. `Year_End_Balance = Beginning_Balance - Annual_Withdrawal + Investment_Return`
6. `Withdrawal_Rate = (Annual_Withdrawal / Beginning_Balance) √ó 100`
